<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I'm a high school junior based in Portland, Oregon with a strong interest in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning. 
I enjoy exploring real-world problems through data, building models, and developing tools that bridge theory and application. I'm currently working on research projects involving environmental modeling, mathematical modeling of physical systems, and archetectures analysis. I'm always excited to learn new tools, collaborate on interesting problems, and push the boundaries of what I understand.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to learn more about my work, chat, or explore potential collaborations.

[Dark-ISP: Enhancing RAW Image Processing for Low-Light Object Detection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7Z3G2ScIwN)

 **Jiasheng Guo**, **Xin Gao**, Yuxiang Yan, Guanghao Li, Jian Pu

- **Dark-ISP** is a lightweight, self-adaptive ISP plugin that enhances low-light object detection by processing Bayer RAW images. It breaks down traditional ISP pipelines into optimized linear and nonlinear sub-modules, using physics-informed priors for automatic RAW-to-RGB conversion.

[[Project page]](https://github.com/gaoxin/MVP)

- **MVP** introduces a novel approach to incomplete multi-view representation learning by leveraging latent space correspondences in Variational Auto-Encoders, enabling the inference of missing views and enhancing the consistency of multi-view data even with irregularly missing information.
