<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year Master's student in Applied Mathematics at the Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-inspired Intelligence (ISTBI) at Fudan University. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Donghua University in Shanghai.

My research focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning, with particular emphasis on probability distribution modeling, generative models, multimodal and multi-view representation learning, as well as the attack and defense of foundation models. **I am planning to apply for a PhD program for Fall 2026, with a primary research interest in the security of foundation models‚Äîspecifically their vulnerabilities and countermeasures.**

I aim to engage in work that is not only theoretically deep but also simple and effective in practical applications. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to learn more about my work, chat, or explore potential collaborations.

[PAPL-SLAM: Principal Axis-Anchored Monocular Point-Line SLAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12324)

 **Guanghao Li**, Yu Cao, Qi Chen, Yifan Yang, Jian Pu

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=6nkKQDIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=6nkKQDIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

- PAPL-SLAM is a point-line SLAM system that efficiently integrates line structural information and optimization by anchoring lines to a principal axis, reducing the number of parameters, and utilizing probabilistic data association, enabling robust, rapid, and accurate mapping and tracking in both indoor and outdoor environments.
